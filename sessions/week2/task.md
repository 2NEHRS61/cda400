#Internet Technology Session 2 Task
There's lot's to cover this week, don't forget to finish these tasks in your own time if necessary. We'll be checking  in next weeks session that you've completed these tasks.

##1. Create your timetable

Create a new file called `timetable.html` and save it in the folder
`session2` within your `U` drive internet tech folder. Recreate your timetable using the table tags and attributes discussed in todays the lesson. It should resemble the example below:

![time table](assets/timetable.png)

Remember, you can use `<br>` or `<p>` tags to create new lines. You can also wrap text in the `<strong>..</strong>` tags to create a bold effect. It's fine to use these tags within a `<td>`, `<th>` table cell.  

##2. Validate your work so far
Use the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure all your work so far is valid. Your work will be tested for valid HTML when you submit assessment 1.
